<p>Click the button below to revoke the permissions you granted to this application. This means that you are "deauthorizing" the application to use your Facebook data. You will have to login and authorize the application again.
This is not something you would typically expose  in a real-life application, but it is helpful during development in order for you to recreate and fine tune the login and authorization experience a new user will be exposed to.</p>
